### Meeting
1. only play team meeting when actually necessary.
2. effectively
  meeting roles:
  - task leader: make sure the meeting meets its goal
  - relationship leader: make sure everyone has a chance to speak and mediate conflict
3. don't brainstorm as a team. It is not necessarily productive. Discuss existing ideas
4. speak up to break up groupthink
  (everyone thought others may agree with xxx)
5. pizza rule: 3-6 people, if you can, exclude the boss.

### Manage Conflict
1. Accommodation: help smooth over tricky situation, but not too much.
2. Avoidence: if dealing with inappropriate behavior, go to a trusted third party, like hr.
3. Feedback:
- point out the specific behavior
- discuss its impact
- be explicit about what needs to change
 split to 2: say good before say bad
 4. how to apology: say sorry, show them you know, tell them what you are going to do
