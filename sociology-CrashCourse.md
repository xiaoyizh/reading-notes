## Intro

- sociology: society and human behavior

- sociological perspective:
  1. see the general in the particular
  2. see the strange in the familiar: see out of common sense 



## Major Paradigm

- structural functionalism

  society is seen as a complex system whose parts work together to promote stability and social order

  change is thought as bad ->

- conflict theories

  society is composed of different groups that struggle over scarce resources

  - class conflict: Marx, saw them as the source of inequality
  - race conflict, gender conflict

- symbolic interactionism: focus on micro

  understand society as the product of everyday social interactions. We assign the meaning to interactions and objects

## Dubois: race conflict

- race is thought of as a social constructed category of people, who share biological traits that society is important.
- racial formation: the process through which society, political, and economic forces influence how a society defines racial categories and how those categories turning into shaping forces.
- racial resistance: how do different racial groups challenge and change the structures of power

## Max Weber&Modernity

- traditionalism sees the world as having a basic order, and that order is the way things ought to be.

- modernity: rationality: calculability, methodical behavior, reflexivity

- the transition from traditionalism to modernity began with the Protestant Reformation.

- bureaucracy:

  hierarchy: made of a variety of very specialized roles and is held together by formal, written communications.

  impersonally

- legal-rational legitimacy: follow the rules
- charismatic legitimacy: make the rules
- social stratification: class, political parties, status groups
- rationalism is easy to lose reflexivity.

## Symbols, Values & Norms

- culture: the way that non-material objects - like thoughts, action, language, and values - come together with material objects to form a way of life.
- symbols: anything that carries a specific meaning that's recognized by people who share a culture.
- values: the cultural standards that people use to decide what's good or bad, what's right or wrong. They serve as the ideals and guidelines that we live by.
- beliefs: specific ideas about what people thinks is true about the world
- norms: the rules and expectations that guide behavior within a society.
  - folkways: informal little rules that kind of go without saying.
  - mores: more official than folkways and tend to be codified, or formalized, as the stated rules and laws of society.
  - taboo: crucial to a society's moral center, involving behaviors that are always negatively sanctioned.
