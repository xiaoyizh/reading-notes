## Intro

- sociology: society and human behavior

- sociological perspective:
  1. see the general in the particular
  2. see the strange in the familiar: see out of common sense 



## Major Paradigm

- structural functionalism

  society is seen as a complex system whose parts work together to promote stability and social order

  change is thought as bad ->

- conflict theories

  society is composed of different groups that struggle over scarce resources

  - class conflict: Marx, saw them as the source of inequality
  - race conflict, gender conflict

- symbolic interactionism: focus on micro

  understand society as the product of everyday social interactions. We assign the meaning to interactions and objects
